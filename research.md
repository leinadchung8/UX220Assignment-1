# My Research

When looking at the goals I have set in the next coming years and reading articles on student portfolio goals, I have learned that there are multiple steps that are needed to be taken before achieving the goals I have set. One of the biggest step that I can take towards achieving these goals is having a strong base. Having a strong base can mean different things such as having peers and teachers one can rely and fall back on when running into issues. This can be reflected into my goals by surrounding myself with the right peers and making connections with the right teachers. Being able to network and create relationships will allow me to gain a net of people I can always fall back to when running into problems while achieving my goals. Another big step that will help me achieve my goals is constancy and determination. These traits are shown to be the one of the biggest factors of achieving goals in "Goal setting and student achievement: A longitudinal study." In the study they showed the relation of determination and constancy when testing highschool students learning a new language. With student having the similar goals of being able to speak, write and read spanish, it was shown that student who constantly practiced daily, and made multiple attempts retained and felt that they achieved their goals of learning spanish then the students that were not able to practice daily. This can be applied to the goals I have set, as many of the goals are long term goals. Without constancy and determination many of these goals can be side tracked and may not be accomplished with in the time frame. Being constant will also allow me to continue to build and gains skills which may help me achieve my goals.
